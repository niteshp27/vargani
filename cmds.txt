Extra cmd if required

<<<<<-----------The branches we've just created are based on the latest commit of the current active branch—which in our case is master. 
If you want to create a branch (say old_commit_branch) based on a certain commit—such as cafb55d—you can run the following command:
E.G.- git checkout -b old_commit_branch commit-id


<<<<<-----------Go to current branch and then rename it-
E.G.- git branch -m renamed_branch

<<<<<-----------Delete a branch
E.G.- git branch -d new_test_branch  --Always use "-d" and not "-D" as "-d" will not delete branch if commits are not pushed and we will not loose work.
